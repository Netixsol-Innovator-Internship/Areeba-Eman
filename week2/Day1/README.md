Age Calculator App 

Languages:
HTML5 for page structure
CSS3 for styling and layout
Vanilla JavaScript for logic and interactivity

How things work:

The user enters their birth date by filling in the day, month, and year fields.
When the calculate button is clicked:
The app checks for empty or invalid inputs.
It verifies if the date exists on the calendar.
If everything is valid, it calculates the age by comparing the birth date to the current
date.
The results (years, months, days) animate from 0 to the correct numbers.
If the date is invalid or in the future, appropriate error messages are displayed near the input fields.

Features:

-Calculates accurate age in years, months, and days
-Validates user input for correct day, month, and year
-Displays error messages for invalid or empty input
-Animates the result counters after calculation
-Responsive layout from 320px to 1440px screen widths
-A large low-opacity background text is displayed behind the container

Responsiveness
The app layout adjusts for all screen sizes between 320px and 1440px. Input fields stay aligned and the layout remains clean on both mobile and desktop devices.
